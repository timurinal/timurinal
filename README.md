I'm Timur! I'm 15, and currently a student at Lincoln UTC. I do a lot of programming, with a focus on game engine programming. My best programming languages are C/C++ and GLSL, but I am also very good with C#, Java, HLSL, and several others.

I'm currently working on a space simulation sandbox that allows for accurate universe simulations.

I use Arch Linux with Hyprland (thanks end-4 for the dotfiles <3). My favorite games include Minecraft, Satisfactory, and Ultrakill. I also love visual novels like Doki Doki Literature Club, and Class of '09.
